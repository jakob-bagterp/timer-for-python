# How to Install
## Prerequisites
* [Python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org)

Assuming that Python is installed already, you can install Timer with either of the following package managers: PyPI or Homebrew.

## PyPI
For [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/timer-for-python/), execute this command in the terminal:

```shell title=""
pip install timer-for-python
```

Keep the package up to date with this command:

```shell title=""
pip install --upgrade timer-for-python
```

## Homebrew
If you already have installed the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager for Mac and Linux, execute this terminal command to tap and install Timer:

```shell title=""
brew tap jakob-bagterp/timer-for-python
brew install timer-for-python
```

Use the same commands to keep the package up to date with Homebrew.
